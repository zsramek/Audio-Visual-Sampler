Audio-Visual-Sampler
====================
This is an early iOS project I worked on while learning GPUImage, the framework developed by Brad Larson (See: https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage). It allows the user to record an short video and overlay with a short audio clip. Both are looped and can be edited to create simple looped vingnettes. Very rough, but fun to fiddle around with and a great tool for learning.
